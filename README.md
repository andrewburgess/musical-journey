What is it?
---

This is going to be a Spotify app that will let the user pick a song to start with, then
retrieve similar artists from Last.FM and/or Echonest that the user can either pick or the app will
pick for them, then start the process again.

The main idea will be for the user to hopefully find new music to enjoy without venturing too far
away from the main source
